        <h1>First Heading of the Web Page</h1>
        To open this webpage to edit it, save it locally to your own machine as something like index.html. To edit, open in a text editor and make the updates to the HTML. To view it, open it in a Web browser.
        <br>
        Add some text here for your first paragraph. This paragraph will contain the most important or latest information.
        <p></p>
        
        <h2>Second Heading of the Web Page</h2>
        The second paragraph goes here. This very basic web page works ok, but doesn't include any Cascading Stylesheets (that add style - colour or font type and size etc) or a favicon (an icon that appears in the browser tab). It also doesn't include any images or links. Just copy this content into a text editor and save as index.htmnl and then open in your Web browser.
        <p></p>

        <h3>Third Heading of the Web Page for the third most important header</h3>
        This is the third heading if you need it. anything in this paragraph can be used inside any of the headings - 1, 2, 3... 6. They don't need to be restricted to any of these sections in your own website.
        <br>
        <strong>You can have up to 6 levels of headings.</strong>
        <p></p>
        This template doesn't contain any formating in Cascading Stylesheets as that is a subject in itself.
